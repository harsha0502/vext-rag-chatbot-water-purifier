# ðŸ’§ Vext-Powered RAG Chatbot for Water Purifier Company

This is a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** chatbot built using [Vext](https://github.com/vext-ai/vext), designed for a water purifier company's customer support system.

It uses a custom pipeline of **two LLMs**, a **vector database**, and a **PDF-based knowledge base** to provide contextual, accurate responses to product-related questions.

---

## ðŸ§  Architecture (5-Stage Pipeline)

1. **Input Received**:  
   The chatbot receives a question from the user, called the `payload`.

2. **LLM 1 â€” GPT-4o Mini**:  
   Used to convert the user's question into keyword search terms.
   ```text
   System Prompt:
   Turn the question the user has asked below into a string of keywords that could be searched on Google to effectively find results about business-related questions.

   Question: 
   payload

   Only provide the keywords, nothing else:
3. **Vector Search (PDF-based)**
   The keywords are used to query a vector database, which was created by embedding a PDF file containing common customer questions and answers.
   Vext automatically handles parsing the PDF, chunking the content, generating vector embeddings, and indexing them, allowing for fast, relevant retrieval of context based on the keyword query.

4. **LLM 2 â€” Mistral 7B (Answer Generator)**
   The retrieved context from the vector database (action_2_output) and the original user question (payload) are passed to Mistral 7B with this system prompt to generate a helpful, conversational response:
   ```text
   <s>You are a sophisticated QA Bot with access to a vast search database. Your role is to help users with their queries and assist them accordingly based on their requirements and past chat history.

5. **Final Response Sent to Client**
   The answer generated by Mistral 7B is sent back through Vextâ€™s webhook, completing the interaction loop.
